The SFM3300 mass flow meter is a sensor for proximal flow measurement in respiratory applications such as ventilation or anesthesia. There are two versions available: the SFM3300-AW is *Autoclavable* and *Washable* and the SFM3300-D is *Disposal*.

The SFM3300 features outstanding measuring accuracy and robustness as well as a short signal processing time. The digital flow sensor measures bidirectional flow volumes of up to 250 slm and is fully calibrated for air, N2 and O2 gases. The special design of the flow channel results in a low dead space volume and the slightly greater pressure drop ensures more stability compared to variable inlet conditions. The sensor also features medical cones for pneumatic connection to the respiratory cycle and has a mechanical interface for a user-friendly electrical connection. Thanks to its performance characteristics, the SFM3300 mass flow meter is ideally suited for single-use proximal flow measurements in medical ventilation, hospital applications, residential care applications and emergency situations.

## Arduino Interfacing
This secton describes the I2C communication with the SFM3xxx sensor series. Communication between the master and the SFM3xxx series sensor runs via the digital I2C-interface. 
**I2C Connection**
Bi-directional bus lines are implemented by the devices (master and slave) using open-drain output stages and a pull-up resistor (R) connected to the positive supply voltage (5V +- 5%). The recommended pull-up resistor value is 10kOhm. In case of long wires (>10cm) it is necessary to shield SDA and SCL. Wires longer than 30cm should not be used.
**I2C Address**
By default, the I2C address is set to 64 (0x40).
